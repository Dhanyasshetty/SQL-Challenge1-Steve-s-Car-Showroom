# SQL-Challenge1-Steve-s-Car-Showroom
SQL Challenge 3 - Steve's Car Showroom, organised by Steel Data and Matthew Steel .Here I'm sharing my case study presentation on given data with solutions.
Objective: Steve runs a top-end car showroom but his data analyst has just quit and left him without his crucial insights. As a Data Analyst we have to analyze the given data to find out crucial information about the car sale and to provide him with all the answers he requires.
The case study consists of 3 tables, namely: Sales, Cars and Salespersons.

Tool Used : MySQL

Throughout this project, I used several essential SQL functions including,
JOINS, COUNT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, SUM, LIMIT, WHERE CLAUSE.

Special thanks to @steeldata and @MatthewSteel for this amazing case study.
